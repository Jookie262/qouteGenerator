                                    <p>Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann
                                        Einstein,
                                        was
                                        originally
                                        a featherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate
                                        success.
                                        His
                                        mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. He had one

                                        Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early years. The
                                        first
                                        was
                                        his

                                        at age five. He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect

                                        needle. This would lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. The
                                        second
                                        wonder
                                        came
                                        at age 12 when he discovered a book of <a

                                    <p>Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in
                                        praise of
                                        God
                                        and
                                        chanting religious songs on the way to school. This began to change,
                                        however,
                                        after
                                        he

                                        books that contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge to established
                                        authority left a deep and lasting impression. At the Luitpold <a

                                        Einstein often
                                        felt
                                        out of place and victimized by a Prussian-style educational system that
                                        seemed
                                        to

                                        originality and creativity. One teacher even told him that he would never

                                        when Einstein was 16. Talmud had earlier introduced him to a children’s

                                        Einstein then asked himself the question that would dominate

                                        it? If light were a wave, then the light beam should appear stationary, like

                                        Even as a child, though, he knew that stationary light waves had never been

                                        Einstein’s father became seriously ill and, just before he died, gave
                                        his
                                        blessing for his son to marry Maric. For years, Einstein would experience

                                        sadness
                                        remembering that his father had died thinking him a failure.

                                    <p>Even as his fame spread, Einstein’s marriage was falling apart. He was constantly
                                        on the road, speaking at international conferences, and lost in contemplation of

                                        couple argued frequently about their children and their meager
                                        finances. Convinced that his marriage was doomed, Einstein began an affair with
                                        a cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, whom he later married. (Elsa was a first cousin on his
