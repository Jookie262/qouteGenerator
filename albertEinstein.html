                                a Serbian physics student whom he had met at school in Zürich. They had three children:
                                a daughter, named Lieserl, and two sons, named Hans and Eduard. After a period of
                                unrest, Einstein and Maric divorced in 1919. Einstein, during his marriage, had begun an

                        <p>Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein, was
                            originally
                            a featherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His
                            mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household. He had one sister, Maria (who
                            went by
                            the name Maja), born two years after Albert.

                            Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early years. The first was his
                            encounter with a <a
                                href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/compass-navigational-instrument">compass</a>
                            at age five. He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect
                            the
                            needle. This would lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. The second wonder
                            came
                            at age 12 when he discovered a book of <a
                                href="https://www.britannica.com/science/geometry">geometry</a>, which he devoured,
                            calling it his “sacred
                            little geometry book.”

                        <p>Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and
                            chanting religious songs on the way to school. This began to change, however, after he read
                            science books that contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge to established
                            authority left a deep and lasting impression. At the Luitpold Gymnasium, Einstein often felt
                            out of place and victimized by a Prussian-style educational system that seemed to stifle
                            originality and creativity. One teacher even told him that he would never amount to
                            anything.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Yet another important influence on Einstein was a young medical student, Max Talmud (later
                            Max Talmey), who often had dinner at the Einstein home. Talmud became an informal tutor,
                            introducing Einstein to higher mathematics and philosophy. A pivotal turning point occurred
                            when Einstein was 16. Talmud had earlier introduced him to a children’s science series by
                            Aaron Bernstein, Naturwissenschaftliche Volksbucher (1867–68; Popular Books on Physical
                            Science), in which the author imagined riding alongside electricity that was traveling
                            inside a telegraph wire. Einstein then asked himself the question that would dominate his
                            thinking for the next 10 years: What would a light beam look like if you could run alongside
                            it? If light were a wave, then the light beam should appear stationary, like a frozen wave.
                            Even as a child, though, he knew that stationary light waves had never been seen, so there
                            was a paradox. Einstein also wrote his first “scientific paper” at that time (“The
                            Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields”).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Einstein’s education was disrupted by his father’s repeated failures at business. In 1894,
                            after his company failed to get an important contract to electrify the city of Munich,
                            Hermann Einstein moved to Milan to work with a relative. Einstein was left at a
                            boardinghouse in Munich and expected to finish his education. Alone, miserable, and repelled
                            by the looming prospect of military duty when he turned 16, Einstein ran away six months
                            later and landed on the doorstep of his surprised parents. His parents realized the enormous
                            problems that he faced as a school dropout and draft dodger with no employable skills. His
                            prospects did not look promising.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Fortunately, Einstein could apply directly to the Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule
                            (“Swiss Federal Polytechnic School”; in 1911, following expansion in 1909 to full university
                            status, it was renamed the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, or “Swiss Federal Institute
                            of Technology”) in Zürich without the equivalent of a high school diploma if he passed its
                            stiff entrance examinations. His marks showed that he excelled in mathematics and physics,
                            but he failed at French, chemistry, and biology. Because of his exceptional math scores, he
                            was allowed into the polytechnic on the condition that he first finish his formal schooling.
                            He went to a special high school run by Jost Winteler in Aarau, Switzerland, and graduated
                            in 1896. He also renounced his German citizenship at that time. (He was stateless until
                            1901, when he was granted Swiss citizenship.) He became lifelong friends with the Winteler
                            family, with whom he had been boarding. (Winteler’s daughter, Marie, was Einstein’s first
                            love; Einstein’s sister, Maja, would eventually marry Winteler’s son Paul; and his close
                            friend Michele Besso would marry their eldest daughter, Anna.)</p>

                        <p>Einstein would recall that his years in Zürich were some of the happiest years of his life.
                            He met many students who would become loyal friends, such as Marcel Grossmann, a
                            mathematician, and Besso, with whom he enjoyed lengthy conversations about space and time.
                            He also met his future wife, Mileva Maric, a fellow physics student from Serbia.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>After graduation in 1900, Einstein faced one of the greatest crises in his life. Because he
                            studied advanced subjects on his own, he often cut classes; this earned him the animosity of
                            some professors, especially Heinrich Weber. Unfortunately, Einstein asked Weber for a letter
                            of recommendation. Einstein was subsequently turned down for every academic position that he
                            applied to. He later wrote,</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Einstein’s relationship with Maric deepened, but his parents vehemently opposed
                            the relationship. His mother especially objected to her Serbian background (Maric’s family
                            was Eastern Orthodox Christian). Einstein defied his parents, however, and in January 1902
                            he and Maric even had a child, Lieserl, whose fate is unknown. (It is commonly thought that
                            she died of scarlet fever or was given up for adoption.)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>In 1902 Einstein reached perhaps the lowest point in his life. He could not marry Maric and
                            support a family without a job, and his father’s business went bankrupt. Desperate and
                            unemployed, Einstein took lowly jobs tutoring children, but he was fired from even these
                            jobs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>The turning point came later that year, when the father of his lifelong friend Marcel
                            Grossmann was able to recommend him for a position as a clerk in the Swiss patent office in
                            Bern. About then, Einstein’s father became seriously ill and, just before he died, gave his
                            blessing for his son to marry Maric. For years, Einstein would experience enormous sadness
                            remembering that his father had died thinking him a failure.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>With a small but steady income for the first time, Einstein felt confident enough to marry
                            Maric, which he did on January 6, 1903. Their children, Hans Albert and Eduard, were born in
                            Bern in 1904 and 1910, respectively. In hindsight, Einstein’s job at the patent office was a
                            blessing. He would quickly finish analyzing patent applications, leaving him time to
                            daydream about the vision that had obsessed him since he was 16: What would happen if you
                            raced alongside a light beam? While at the polytechnic school he had studied Maxwell’s
                            equations, which describe the nature of light, and discovered a fact unknown to James Clerk
                            Maxwell himself—namely, that the speed of light remains the same no matter how fast one
                            moves. This violates Newton’s laws of motion, however, because there is no absolute velocity
                            in Isaac Newton’s theory. This insight led Einstein to formulate the principle of
                            relativity: “the speed of light is a constant in any inertial frame (constantly moving
                            frame).”</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>During 1905, often called Einstein’s “miracle year,” he published four papers in the Annalen
                            der Physik, each of which would alter the course of modern physics:
